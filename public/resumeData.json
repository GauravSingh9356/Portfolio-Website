    "bio": "👋 Hi there! I'm a Software Engineer with 3 years of hands-on experience in building scalable, reliable, and maintainable backend services that solve real-world problems and drive business impact. At Amazon, I design and develop highly available, fault-tolerant distributed systems. I led the end-to-end development of a notification service for Alexa Emergency Assist, achieving a 21% reduction in system latency. I played a key role in the launch of Alexa+ by integrating Amazon Prime membership subscriptions, helping drive adoption by millions of customers. Additionally, I collaborated on integrating a domain-specific Emergency/Safety Expert powered by LLMs into Alexa+. I also implemented core system improvements that reduced operational noise by 19%, contributing significantly to the team’s operational excellence. Previously, at C-DOT (Centre for Development of Telematics), I worked as a Software Engineer and Scientist, where I designed microservices that processed 100K+ transactions daily. I played a significant role in national-scale projects like ASTRA, enhancing fraud detection systems used across India. I hold a strong foundation in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kalyani (IIIT Kalyani), and I'm passionate about solving complex backend challenges, cloud computing, and full-stack development. I’m an avid learner who thrives in collaborative environments and is always eager to explore the latest in tech. Whether it’s optimizing system performance or diving into a new framework, I bring curiosity, ownership, and a growth mindset to everything I do. Let’s connect if you're looking for someone who’s passionate about backend systems, cloud architecture, and building impactful tech solutions! 🚀",
